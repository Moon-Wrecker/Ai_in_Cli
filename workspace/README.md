# Welcome to AI Assistant Workspace

This is your dedicated workspace directory where the AI assistant will perform all file operations.

## What's in this folder?
- All files and folders created by the AI assistant will be placed here
- This keeps your project files separate from the AI assistant's working files
- You can safely create, modify, and delete files here without affecting the assistant

## Getting Started
Try these commands:
- "Create a new file called notes.txt with some content"
- "Create a folder called projects" 
- "List all files in this directory"
- "Create a Python script that prints hello world"

Happy coding! 🚀
